"5","Classy product","High quality camera The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.","Saikrishna Kathi","Certified Buyer","Jan, 2024","3","2"
"4","Wonderful","Not justifying the price .. bit disappointed about the  display (refresh rate should be high).. no differences between 12 and 15 except brightness .. those who willing to upgrade plz be ok with your 13 .. there is very low difference in day to day life use..but the Dynamic Island is awesome it is way better than expected..","Asif ikbal Shaikh","Certified Buyer","Jan, 2024","6","7"
"4","Very Good","AFTER ONE WEEK OVERALL PERFOMANCE IS GOOD BUT  FEW APPLE MUST IMPROVE 1. Design very Round on Corner gives a feel of baby Toy, 2. Some thing must improve in iOS 17 its very Classic in this mordern era like Auto Rotate not possible on photos you will have to go home select rotate lock etc.","Yogendra  Tiwari","Certified Buyer","Jan, 2024","3","2"

"5","Super!","The best iphone to buy right now. Chose the 512 gb variant. It has type c, great battery life and overall great size as well. Thought of getting the plus but it was too big. But that does have good battery life. But this one has a great battery life even with a small battery. Also no words to say about camera and performance. Great absolutely beautiful. I went for the 512 gb storage because this uses more space for photos with the new 48 mp camera. Iphone should really make the base variant a...","Jeffin Jacob Paul","Certified Buyer","11 months ago","2","1"

"5","Mind-blowing purchase","Honestly speaking, long term android users will not get satisfied with iOS, the iPhone is good for social status and shows off, but obviously we always want to have an iphone. If you are looking for a good camera quality then go for s23/s24 (even the base model) , but if you are just looking for a phone with social status then go for this technologcal beauty.","kushal Dey","Certified Buyer","Oct, 2024","2","1"
