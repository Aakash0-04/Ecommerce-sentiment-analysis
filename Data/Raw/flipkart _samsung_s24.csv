"3","Decent product","Phone form factor and camera are excellent. Major drawbacks are the heating issue when using camera and the faster battery drain. These may be attributed to the Samsung's Exynos processor's inferior performance.

"4","Good choice","The is phone is really excellent. But its battery is the worst i would say, if you're an even moderate user, think thrice before buying this phone. If you go out for a prolonged time, always have a fully charged powerbank with you. This is definitely not for high performance users. Camera is really good at this price, while its battery is horrible.  If you have another phone that can be good.","Tamalika Sil","Certified Buyer","1 month ago","0","0"
