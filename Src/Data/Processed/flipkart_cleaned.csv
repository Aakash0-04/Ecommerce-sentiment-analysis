5.0,Worth every penny,Hi All. I am writing this review based on my 1 week usage. I bought it in the BBD Sale only.

4.0,Very Good,"Like others, I was also initially concerned about its smaller battery capacity and slow charging speed before buying it. But one thing I would like to mention for whoever is planning to buy it now (snapdragon version), if you are not heavy gamer, then you can expect easily  backup of one day or even more.

5.0,Brilliant,"Since thousands of reviews have been written on this phone, it seems unnecessary for me to delve deeper into the details. It's a wonderful compact phone with great design, wonderful display and unmatched UI. Only area it is lacking in is battery and camera hardware. Samsung has to work seriously on these two aspects.

3.0,Decent product,Phone form factor and camera are excellent. Major drawbacks are the heating issue when using camera and the faster battery drain. These may be attributed to the Samsung's Exynos processor's inferior performance.

5.0,Must buy!,Using this phone for one week now. Overall a decent choice if your not into gaming (go for 13R).. BUILD and Design is excellent. In hand feel is too good.

In case of wifi its does gets warm but after 20 min.Camera is great for the price.. no network issues so far( im using jio). Performance is best for the price.
